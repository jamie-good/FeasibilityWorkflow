    "- If you have more buffer features than outlined here, you can just add them to the list!\n",
    "- Outputs of interest: (1) any of the PhiH_poly_masked layers (polygons of buffered PhiH with cutoffs of 80 & 200), (2) any of the PhiH_masked layers (same, but rasters), and (3) PhiH_Total_Counties (table containing square mileage calculations in the order of PhiH>0, PhiH>80, and PhiH>200). "
