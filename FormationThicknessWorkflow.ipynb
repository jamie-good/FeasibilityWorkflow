    "- Use double quotation marks for any paths, layers, or field names (i.e., strings) - but not for numeric entries.\n",
    "- Keep the r in front of your gdb_path string - this makes it readable. \n",
    "- If a layer you want to use is in a group, make sure to include it's group name in it's path (i.e., \"GroupName/LayerName\" - the relative path.)\n",
    "- For entries in \"buffer_features\", the buffer distance must be formatted as \"X Mile\"\n",
    "- If you have more buffer features than outlined here, you can just add them to the list!\n",
    "- Outputs of interest: (1) any of the PhiH_poly_masked layers (polygons of buffered PhiH with cutoffs of 80 & 200), (2) any of the PhiH_masked layers (same, but rasters), and (3) PhiH_Total_Counties (table containing square mileage calculations in the order of PhiH>0, PhiH>80, and PhiH>200). "
